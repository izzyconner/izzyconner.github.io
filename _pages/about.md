### Who I Am

Hi! I'm Izzy, a third year undergraduate student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Game Design. Currently, I'm focusing on learning more about computer graphics and building my C++ skills. I'd like to eventually work on engine programming/development or graphics systems for games, but also have enjoyed creating small levels and games in Unity and would love to get more professional experience with it. I'm also open to back-end development for software engineering - my experience is somewhat limited, but I have a solid background with C++ and Java along with some small tinkering with the Spring framework that I can easily expand upon.

Outside of classes and projects, I've spent quite a bit of time the last two and a half years working at Northeastern's ITS department with an absolutely amazing team. I've done everything from answer phone calls and troubleshoot, to lead the customer service team, to recruit new hires, to my current Microsoft-focused position of a Digital Solutions Engineer. I love playing around with the various tools we have at our disposal to create efficient, well-put together workflows for the faculty I work with now, and very rarely miss my call center days.

### Other (less important) tidbits

If I'm not working, coding, or trying to design one of my game projects, I'll probably be crocheting some slippers or unsurprisingly playing games. I love puzzle and platformer games with a special nostalgic spot for Myst and Riven, and have recently been putting a lot of hours into Stardew Valley, Hollow Knight, and a lesser-known game Evergate that I discovered at BostonFIG Fest a couple years ago. If my eyes simply cannot look at pixels on a screen for another minute, I've been known to hold my own in a game of Bananagrams and Boggle. Whenever I can get the chance, I also enjoy hiking and recently did a solo cross-country road trip to visit some of national parks along the way!
