### Who I Am

Hi! I'm Izzy, a fourth year undergraduate student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Game Design with two co-ops under my belt, and have primary interests in software and graphics engineering for games. Previously, I've worked as a Software Engineer co-op at Priceline using Java, and have experience in C++ and Unity/C# for academic projects that range from game demos to graphics renderers. 

Outside of classes and projects, I've spent quite a bit of time the last three and a half years working at Northeastern's ITS department with an absolutely amazing team. I've done everything from answer phone calls and troubleshoot, to lead the customer service team, to recruit new hires, to my current Microsoft-focused position of a Digital Solutions Engineer. I love playing around with the various tools we have at our disposal to create efficient, well-put together workflows for the faculty I work with now, and very rarely miss my call center days.

### Other (less important) tidbits

If I'm not working, coding, or trying to design one of my game projects, I'll probably be crocheting some slippers or unsurprisingly playing games. I love puzzle games, platformers, and roguelites with a special nostalgic spot for Myst and Riven, and have recently been putting a lot of hours into Noita. I've been known to hold my own in a game of Bananagrams and Boggle. Whenever I can get the chance, I also enjoy hiking and recently did a solo cross-country road trip to visit some of national parks along the way!
