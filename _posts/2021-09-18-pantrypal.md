### *Tools, libraries, and languages used: Java and Spring framework*
Developed in September of 2021 for HackMIT, my team (3) and I created a working prototype of our web app Pantry Pal, which placed second for the Microsoft Azure award. Designed to be used by local community members and food pantries, our application would allow food pantries/kitchens to keep an update list of current grocery items they needed. The app would also allow users to search for specific food items or categories that they wanted to donate, and be matched with food pantries nearby that would accept them. I coded a large portion of the backend/API, learning the Spring web framework for the hackathon and working with one other backend developer. We developed a set of API endpoints using Java's Spring framework, along with other libraries like javax.persistance, using JPA for persistence that tied into our SQL database.

Check out the video below that includes a walkthrough of the application, and how we used Azure to make it possible!
