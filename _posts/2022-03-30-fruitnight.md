For our Game Concept Development class (SP '22), I worked in a team of five student developers to create this 2D mash-up of dating sim and RPG, where the player takes the role of the newest fruit in the kitchen. Throughout the game, they can talk to other fruits, building up their relationship with them, and then go practice their best combat moves to prepare for the ultimate tournament... the Great Blender.

My roles for the game included:
<ul>
<li>2D Character Artist</li>
<li>Combat Co-designer</li>
<li>Co-programmer (combat system and Unity scenes)</li>
<li>Co-writer (character dialogue)</li>
<li>Last but certainly not least, voice actor for Strawberry sounds</li>
</ul>
