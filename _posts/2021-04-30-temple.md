For my final project in CS3450 Game Programming, my team (3) and I developed a demo of a small 3D puzzle game called Temple of Fate in Unity.

In this first-person puzzle adventure game, players would navigate through an ancient temple using their Tele, a throwable cube which acted as a teleportation device.

My roles in this project spanned level design and game programming. I designed and then created the first two levels, with the entire team contributing to the greyboxing of the levels, and I worked with another team member to design and create the final level. I also programmed various behaviors and puzzles in the game.
